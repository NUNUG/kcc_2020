## About the Class

TODO: Update me.

The class comprises 3 aspects.
- There are instructional videos for you to watch.  There are videos for setting everything up, videos for the game building and possibly some supplemental videos.
- There is source code for each step along the way that has been typed out for you.  If you don't want to type it, use the source code.  If you mess something up and don't know where the problem is, use the source code to figure it out.
- There is a RESET program.  This is a convenient way to switch between each of the steps in the instructional videos.  If you ever have a problem typing out the code, you can use the RESET program to move to the next step, or to the previous step so you can try again.
